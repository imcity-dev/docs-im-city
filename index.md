{: .note }
>The IM.CITY platform is part of the IM.UR.CITY project, [docs.UR.CITY] and [docs.IM.CITY] are twin platforms that work together to create a unique ecosystem where #intelligentAgents are developed and used to facilitate real-life social interactions.

# Real-Life Social Interaction and Decision-Making Revolutionized by Intelligent Agents

&nbsp;


----------------

{: .highlight }
IM.CITY is an online platform that provides **digital communities and organizations** with better tools for **social interactions** and **collective decisions**. (Proof of Concept).

&nbsp;

IM.CITY is a digital platform that utilizes intelligent agents to facilitate real-life social interactions and augmented decision-making in urban contexts. By leveraging the power of AI and DLT, IM.CITY offers a new level of efficiency, transparency, and community engagement. As part of the **Decision-Making Engine (DME)**, the platform includes modules such as the IdeaBox, which allows creators to present their ideas and allows readers to consume them in different formats. The IdeaStream, a dialogue and debate module, allows participants to comment and present their own ideas and the IdeaVote, a voting module. IM.CITY is a unique ecosystem that offers a new way for urban communities to interact and make decisions that truly reflect the needs and preferences of the people within them.

Users can provide data and ideas as part of the decision-making process, and have the option to use Intelligent Agents (AI tools) to provide them with information or suggestions. These **Intelligent Agents** are powered by the OpenAI API, and can be accessed by spending a digital token called the **Digital Intelligence Token ($DIT)**. Users can earn $DIT tokens through a Universal Basic Income (UBI) automated mechanism, or purchase them from the platform or from other users.

In addition to the DME, our platform also includes a **Digital Rewards Engine (DRE)** for managing different types of digital rewards for users, including UBI and other mechanisms. The **Digital City Token ($DCT)** is the main token of the platform, and can be used to access features and services on the platform. Users can earn $DCT tokens, purchase them, or transfer them to/from other users.

IM.CITY also includes **Digital Spaces** where users can check in and participate. These Digital Spaces can be owned by individuals or organizations, and provide a place for communities to come together and collaborate. Users can create their own Digital Spaces or join existing ones, and can customize the privacy and accessibility settings to suit their needs. Within a Digital Space, users can use the tools provided by the DME to conduct collective decision-making processes, and can earn or spend Digital Intelligence Tokens ($DIT) and Digital City Tokens ($DCT) as part of the process. **Digital Space Tokens ($DST)** are used to determine the capacity of a Digital Space.

As our platform evolves, we plan to eventually release CityOS, an operating system for digital city states â€“ a new form of independent cities. Based on CityOS, anyone will be able to create and manage their own digital city and manage their community.

Please note that this project is currently in its early stages of planning it as a Proof of Concept (PoC). We believe that IM.CITY and CityOS have the potential to revolutionize the way communities and organizations make decisions, and we invite you to join us on this journey as we build a better future together.
