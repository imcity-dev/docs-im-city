>The IM.CITY - CityOS ecosystem operates with 3 different types of tokens: $IMCT (this is the community token), $CTY and $VCT, along some other contextual tokens. Please make sure you understand the difference between these tokens before you start using the platform.
>You may find more information about the tokens in the section of each platform documentation:  [docs.IM.CITY/tokenomics](https://docs.im.city/tokenomics/){:target="_blank"} and [docs.UR.CITY/tokenomics](https://docs.ur.city/tokenomics/){:target="_blank"}


**Following an entire year of development while facing big unexpected events both at the macro level (war, bear market) and at the micro level (the lack of funding solutions) it is only natural to adapt and make decisions on how to optimize the development in the next year.**



## The Separation of Concerns

----------------

As you already know, I have spent the last several months working on holistic solutions.      
I have been trying to find a way to combine the digital city layer with the virtual layer in a way that will make sense for the users and will be easy to use. 
While this is one of the main goals of the IM.CITY project, it makes more sense now to fist build the components separately and join them only when they are functional.

**Separation of concerns** is a design principle in which different aspects of a system are handled by separate components or modules, each of which is responsible for a specific concern or functionality. This allows the different components to be developed and tested independently, and makes it easier to modify and maintain the system as a whole. 

So, we will apply this principle to the IM.CITY ecosystem and split different components in order to clarify their purpose and development.


### Conceptualization vs Development

The [Digital City Institute](https://digital.city.institute){:target="_blank"} is a think tank exploring and advancing the concept of the “Digital City”, focused on how technology can be used to improve social interactions and make modern communities more collaborative and participatory through digital rewards systems.

### Framework vs Application

- The [CityOS.dev](http://cityos.dev){:target="_blank"} represent the framework that will be used to build the IM.CITY platform. It is a set of tools and libraries that will be used to build the IM.CITY platform and other similar platforms in the future.
 
- [IM.CITY](https://IM.CITY){:target="_blank"} / [UR.CITY](https://UR.CITY){:target="_blank"} represent the applications side that will be built on top of the CityOS operating system (framework).


### Digital Layer vs Virtual Layer

- [IM.CITY](https://IM.CITY){:target="_blank"} is the online platform managing the **digital layer** of the social interactions.
- [UR.CITY](https://UR.CITY){:target="_blank"} is the online platform managing the **virtual layer** of the social interactions.

You can read more about the difference between the two layers in the [IM.CITY - CityOS Ecosystem](https://cityos.dev/#digital-city-vs-virtual-city){:target="_blank"} documentation.


## The Proof of Concept

----------------


The holistic approach and trying to update and prepare the legacy data before validating the concepts and technology consumed a lot of time and resources. 

After careful consideration, I have decided to reset the development and return to the proof of concept stage (PoC).

There are a few reasons why I made this decision. First and foremost, I realized that the focus on preparing the legacy data was hindering our ability to validate the concept and technology. By trying to fit the data into the new frameworks even before the solution is validated, I was limiting our creativity and ability to explore new ideas.

Additionally, I found that the holistic approach was not as effective as I had hoped. While it may have worked for some aspects of the project, it was not a one-size-fits-all solution. By returning to the proof of concept stage, we will be able to focus on individual components and tailor our approach to each specific topic.

Furthermore, by resetting to the proof of concept stage, we will be able to gather more accurate data and feedback and create effective communication channels with Digital City Institute structures. This will allow us to make more informed decisions and ensure that we are on the right track.

Ultimately, the decision to reset the development and return to the proof of concept stage was driven by my desire to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. I believe that this will give us the best chance of success. 

The PoC approach imply the separation of the initial IM.CITY platform into two different platforms: IM.CITY for the **digital city** layer and UR.CITY for the **virtual layer**. Both platforms will start in January 2023 with a fresh database install. All existing data (users, $IMCT tokens)  will be archived and re-joined at a later stage.      
So, if you are a user of the IM.CITY platform, you will have to create a new account and start from scratch. Your $IMCT tokens will be archived and re-joined at a later stage. **The $IMCT tokens will not be lost!** Only they will be visible and usable at a later stage when the proof of concept stage is completed and the MVP stage is started.


## The communication channels

----------------

Following the separation of concerns principle, we will separate the functionality and the communication channels for each platform. 
The content and communication part of each platform will be presented in a separate documentation site:
- CityOs: [docs.cityos.dev](https://docs.cityos.dev){:target="_blank"}
- IM.CITY: [docs.im.city](https://docs.im.city){:target="_blank"}
- UR.CITY: [docs.ur.city](https://docs.ur.city){:target="_blank"}

In order to assure the highest level or transparency and provide easy collaboration tools, each documentation site is open, and you can contribute to the content by creating a pull request on the GitHub.

**Note: all documentation sites are considered as a work in progress and will be updated on a regular basis.**



## The Development Principles

----------------

The development work will be based on an adapted set o principles that will help to increase the speed of development and ensure that we are on the right track.

1. Modular Architecture

2. OS on Stop

3. PoC before MVP

4. CRUD before DDD

5. ReMaSc

You can read about each principle in the [Development Principles](https://cityos.dev/principles/){:target=_blank} page of the CityOS documentation. 


## The Soonaverse Collections

----------------


In the spring of 2022 we launched a set of Soonaverse.com collections in the form of _"pre-sale certificates"_ for _"virtual citizens"_ and _"virtual land"_. 

At the end of 2022, on 30th of December, the Soonaverse collections will be minted to the Shimmer Network and all unsold items will be burnt.

Also, we will change the name of the elements in order to use a more adapted terminology. 

#### Intelligent Agents

The "virtual citizens" will be renamed to "Intelligent Agents"    
More details of the elements usage will be presented on the element page at [CityOS Elements](https://cityos.dev/elements/city-spaces/){:target=_blank} page.

[Soonaverse Collection](https://soonaverse.com/collection/0x4c2ae83020cb2bde6fde62564fd42751f334f338){:target="_blank"}

#### City Space

The "virtual land" will be renamed to "City Space"        
More details of the elements usage will be presented on the element page at [CityOS Elements](https://cityos.dev/elements/intelligent-agents/){:target=_blank} page.

[Soonaverse Collection](https://soonaverse.com/collection/0xa63f4ccc74dd9d3d2ebc1e7933fb717e2b8a7c02){:target="_blank"}

&nbsp;

Each element will have two versions as "digital" for IM.CITY platform and "virtual" for UR.CITY platform, and they will be sold separately in the future.

**However, as a sign of appreciation for our community and their support in very early stages, all pre-sale certificates from the Soonaverse Collections will be valid on both the Digital City (IM.CITY) and the Virtual City (UR.CITY).**

**In addition to all the above decisions, there is a continuous work to clarify the vision and the best way to implement it.**

As I always said, this is not a regular project, and it can not be based on a one man's ideas.      
It is a project that requires a lot of collaboration and a lot of people to be involved.      
But people are involving in projects they feel they can contribute to and in order to make this happen, we need to have a clear vision and a clear roadmap.      

In a way, it is kind of a vicious circle. But we started to break it and more and more people are paying attention and are willing to contribute.

**I want to thank you for your support and patience**, and I am looking forward to working with you in the future and I hope that you will continue to support the IM.CITY - CityOS project.       
I am excited to see what the future holds for the Digital City Spaces and I hope you are too.
