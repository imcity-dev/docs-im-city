>Both platforms will start in January 2023 with a fresh database install. All existing data (users, $IMCT tokens)  will be archived and re-joined at a later stage.

{: .note }
>The IM.CITY - CityOS ecosystem operates with 3 different types of tokens: $IMCT (this is the community token), $CTY and $VCT, along some other contextual tokens. Please make sure you understand the difference between these tokens before you start using the platform.
>You may find more information about the tokens in the section of each platform documentation:  [docs.IM.CITY/tokenomics](https://docs.im.city/tokenomics/){:target="_blank"} and [docs.UR.CITY/tokenomics](https://docs.ur.city/tokenomics/){:target="_blank"}


**Following an entire year of development while facing big unexpected events both at the macro level (war, bear market) and at the micro level (the lack of funding solutions) it is only natural to adapt and make decisions on how to optimize the development in the next year.**



## The Separation of Concerns

----------------






## The Development Principles

----------------

The development work will be based on a set o principles that will help to increase the speed of development and ensure that we are on the right track. 

1. Modular Architecture

2. OS on Stop

3. PoC before MVP

4. CRUD before DDD

5. ReMaSc

You can read about each principle in the [Principles](https://cityos.dev/principles/){:target=_blank} page of the CityOS documentation.


## The Proof of Concept

----------------


As you already know, I have spent the last several months working on holistic solutions and trying to update and prepare the legacy data before validating the concepts and technology. This approach consumed a lot of time and resources. After careful consideration, I have decided to reset the development and return to the proof of concept stage (PoC).

There are a few reasons why I made this decision. First and foremost, I realized that the focus on preparing the legacy data was hindering our ability to validate the concept and technology. By trying to fit the data into the new frameworks even before the solution is validated, I was limiting our creativity and ability to explore new ideas.

Additionally, I found that the holistic approach was not as effective as I had hoped. While it may have worked for some aspects of the project, it was not a one-size-fits-all solution. By returning to the proof of concept stage, we will be able to focus on individual components and tailor our approach to each specific topic.

Furthermore, by resetting to the proof of concept stage, we will be able to gather more accurate data and feedback and create effective communication channels with Digital City Institute structures. This will allow us to make more informed decisions and ensure that we are on the right track.

Ultimately, the decision to reset the development and return to the proof of concept stage was driven by my desire to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. I believe that this will give us the best chance of success. 

The PoC approach imply the separation of the initial IM.CITY platform into two different platforms: IM.CITY for the **digital city** layer and UR.CITY for the **virtual layer**. Both platforms will start in January 2023 with a fresh database install. All existing data (users, $IMCT tokens)  will be archived and re-joined at a later stage.      
So, if you are a user of the IM.CITY platform, you will have to create a new account and start from scratch. Your $IMCT tokens will be archived and re-joined at a later stage. **The $IMCT tokens will not be lost!** Only they will be visible and usable at a later stage when the proof of concept stage is completed and the MVP stage is started.


## The communication channels

----------------

Following the separation of concern principle, we will separate the functionality and the communication channels for each platform. 
The content and communication part of each platform will be presented in a separate documentation site:
- CityOs: [docs.cityos.dev](https://docs.cityos.dev){:target="_blank"}
- IM.CITY: [docs.im.city](https://docs.im.city){:target="_blank"}
- UR.CITY: [docs.ur.city](https://docs.ur.city){:target="_blank"}

In order to assure the highest level or transparency and provide easy collaboration tools, each documentation site is open for collaboration, and you can contribute to the content by creating a pull request on the GitHub.

**Note: all documentation sites are considered as a work in progress and will be updated on a regular basis.**
